"I have been using this plugin for several years now and it has always served me well. I found a small issue in the display of serial numbers awhile ago and the support team responded to my ticket very quickly and the issue was fixed in the next update. I recently renewed my yearly license, just before they introduced their Black Friday sale prices. They refunded that purchase in full no questions asked and I re-purchased at the new discounted rate." - [@allarmsllc](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/great-product-great-support-167/)
